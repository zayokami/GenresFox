### The Origin Story of the GenreFox

I know many people don't like hearing stories, but I feel it's necessary to tell this one, because I believe everything we do always has a motivation behind it.

Late on the night of December 3rd, 2025, something happened that made me absolutely furious.



A browser new tab extension I had used for years had been implanted with a backdoor/malicious code, which I found completely intolerable and unacceptable.



I won't say which extension this happened to. The main reason is that without any publicly available audit report, directly naming a commercial software could lead to unnecessary legal trouble for me. 

Moreover, the Microsoft team promptly disabled this extension in the Edge extension store.



Anyway, I was extremely angry at the time, so I immediately started coding my own extension.



And I really detest this sort of thing that's always collecting users' private content (it could even intercept anything the user typed!), so I swore on the spot that I wouldn't just make the best and most powerful one—I would even make it completely open source.



**And thus, GenreFox was born.**




Regarding how the name GenreFox came about:

It was actually a name I typed out randomly, but later found it to be quite "unique," so I kept it (if you Google "GenreFox," the first result will definitely be this project). 

Plus, I really like foxes; they are my favourite animal, bar none.



Actually, GenreFox has no relation to Firefox whatsoever. Many people think it's a project for the Firefox platform, but it's not. However, I am currently developing a version for Firefox, expected to be released in version 0.5.0.



Anyway, that's the story of how this project came to be. Thank you very much for reading.

And I think, if GenresFox had a mascot, it would definitely be a white fox. The white fox is my favourite kind of fox.
